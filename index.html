                        <p>We are a small company who believes that a
                        pets mental health is just as important as its
                        physical healt. Boredom and anxiety are
                        common traits among pets that are not
                        challenged enough mentally - and we see this
                        manifest as "bad" and destructive behavior.</p>

                        <p>"I’ve noticed that if my dog doesn’t
                        have enough “to do” during the pay,
                        she gets antsy...and I’ve lost too many
                        shoes and slippers because of this! After
                        running her around with the flirt pole in
                        the early evening in our backyard,
                        she no longer has the energy to be
                        destructive."</p>

                        be possible to teach my dog to use
                        these buttons. But after watching
                        videos on YouTube I wanted to give
                        this a try. After a few weeks of 
                        training on the first button,
                        she has finally learned the connection
                        between the button and the desired action.
